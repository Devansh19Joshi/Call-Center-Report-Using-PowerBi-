## GitHub Project Report: Call Centre Dataset Analysis

# Project Overview:
This GitHub project focuses on analyzing a Call Centre dataset using Power BI to derive insights and optimize operations. The dataset encompasses crucial information such as caller IDs, agent names, call dates and times, topics, resolution statuses, speed of answer, average talk durations, and satisfaction rates. The primary objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis to enhance the call center's efficiency and improve customer satisfaction.

# Project Structure:

# Data Preprocessing:
  
  1.Null values were handled, and data types were adjusted to ensure consistency.
  
  2.Seconds and minutes were extracted from the average talk duration to enrich the dataset.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
 
 1.Total number of calls was calculated.
 
 2.New columns were created to track calls answered vs. rejected.
 
 3.Resolution status (resolved vs. unresolved) was analyzed.
 
 4.Top performing agents in terms of call volume and satisfaction rates were identified.

# Visualization:

 1.Interactive charts were generated using Power BI to visualize key metrics.
 
 2.Slicers were implemented to allow users to explore data by month and day wise.

# Performance Ratings:
 
 1.Overall performance ratings for the year 2021 were provided.
 
 2.Custom charts depicted satisfaction ratings, offering actionable insights for improvement.

# How to Use:

 1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
 2.Import the dataset into Power BI.
 3.Follow the data preprocessing steps outlined in the documentation.
 4.Run the Power BI project file to visualize the analysis.
 5.Use interactive features to explore data and gain insights.
 6.Refer to the performance ratings section to identify areas for improvement.
